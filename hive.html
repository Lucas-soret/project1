                <h3>Langstroth Hive</h3>
                <p> 
                    This is the most common type of hive used in North America. 
                    It consists of boxes stacked on top of each other, 
                    with frames inside the boxes where the bees build their comb. 
                    The Langstroth hive is popular because it allows for easy 
                    inspection and manipulation of the frames.

                <h3>Top-bar Hive</h3>
                <p>
                    This type of hive is popular in developing countries and 
                    among hobbyist beekeepers. It consists of a long horizontal box with bars 
                    placed across the top, where the bees build their comb. 
                    The Top-Bar hive is simpler and less expensive than the Langstroth hive, 
                    but it can be more difficult to manage and harvest honey.

                <h3>Warre Hive</h3>
                <p>
                    This is a vertical top-bar hive that is designed to mimic 
                    the natural environment of bees. It has a smaller footprint 
                    than the Langstroth hive and is designed to be less intrusive to the bees.

                 <h3>Flow Hive</h3> 
               <p>
                    This is a relatively new type of hive that allows honey to be harvested 
                    without opening the hive or disturbing the bees. It features 
                    plastic frames with pre-formed cells that can be opened to allow 
                    honey to flow out. The Flow Hive is popular among backyard beekeepers 
                    who want a low- maintenance option for harvesting honey.

                    This can be made from a variety of materials, 
                    such as wood, bamboo, or reeds. They typically consist 
                    of a series of tubes or holes of varying sizes, where the 
                    bees can lay their eggs and store food for their larvae. 
                    The size and shape of the tubes or holes can vary depending 
                    on the species of bees you are trying to attract.
